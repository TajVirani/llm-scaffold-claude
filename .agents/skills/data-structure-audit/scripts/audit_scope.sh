#
#   audit_scope.sh scope    Print files changed since the last audited commit(s),
#                           one per line. Prints FULL_AUDIT if no usable state.
#                           Prints nothing if no code has changed.
#   audit_scope.sh record   Append current HEAD to the state file, pruning
#                           entries subsumed by it (ancestors of HEAD).
#
# State lives in .workflow/data-structure-audit-state.jsonl (D81) (one JSON object per
# line) and is meant to be COMMITTED, so it travels with branches and merges.
# The audited set is a union: a file only needs checking if it changed on some
# path not reachable from ANY audited commit.
